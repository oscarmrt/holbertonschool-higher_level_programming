# Write a Python script that takes your Github credentials
# (username and password) and uses the Github API to display your id
# You must use Basic Authentication with a personal access
# token as password to access to your information
# (only read:user permission is needed)
# The first argument will be your username
# The second argument will be your password (in your case,
# a personal access token as password)
# You must use the package requests and sys
# You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
# You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
